The pipex Project

Simulating Bash Pipes in C

As part of your ongoing studies at 42 University, you have been tasked with creating the pipex project,
which aims to simulate the functionality of pipes in the Bash shell using C programming.
Pipes are a powerful feature in Unix-based operating systems, allowing the output of one command to be
seamlessly used as the input for another, enabling the creation of complex command pipelines.
In your implementation of pipex, you will need to leverage file descriptors as a substitute for the
standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) streams typically used in Bash.
This involves managing the low-level file I/O operations and coordinating the flow of data between multiple processes,
just as the shell does when executing a pipe-based command.
By tackling this project, you will deepen your understanding of process management, inter-process communication,
and the underlying mechanisms of the Unix operating system. You will learn to efficiently utilize file descriptors,
fork child processes, and coordinate their execution to achieve the desired pipeline-like behavior.
The successful completion of pipex will demonstrate your ability to translate high-level shell concepts into a
robust C-based implementation. This project not only strengthens your C programming skills but also expands your familiarity
with the fundamental building blocks of Unix-style operating systems.
As you progress through this challenge, you will gain valuable insights into the design and implementation of powerful,
modular, and reusable C functions. These skills will serve you well as you continue to develop more complex
software projects at 42 University and beyond.
